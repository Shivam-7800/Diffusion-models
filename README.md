# Project: Image Inpainting Using Diffusion Models
# Objective:
Develop a system to perform image inpainting using diffusion models, which can fill in missing or damaged parts of an image in a realistic and contextually appropriate manner.

# Overview:
In this project, I implemented a diffusion model to address the problem of image inpainting. The approach leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) framework, which involves a two-step process: forward diffusion, where noise is progressively added to the image, and reverse diffusion, where the model learns to remove the noise and reconstruct the missing parts.

# Key Steps:

# Data Preparation:

Used the CelebA dataset, which contains thousands of face images.
Artificially created masks to simulate missing parts of the images for training.
# Model Implementation:

Designed a UNet-based architecture for the denoising network.
Implemented the forward diffusion process to add varying levels of noise to the images.
Trained the model to predict and remove the noise, effectively inpainting the missing regions.
# Training:

Trained the model using PyTorch, optimizing it to minimize the difference between the original and reconstructed images.
Employed a noise schedule to gradually adjust the noise level during training.
# Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
Conducted qualitative assessments through visual inspection of the inpainted images.
Deployment:

Developed a simple web application using Flask, where users can upload images with missing parts and receive inpainted results.
# Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Frameworks/Libraries: PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab for training

# Outcome:
The project successfully demonstrated the capability of diffusion models in performing high-quality image inpainting. The system was able to fill in missing parts of images with plausible and coherent content, showing the potential of diffusion models in real-world image restoration tasks.
